Lyrics.com is a vast compilation of
song lyrics, album details, and 
Smile an everlasting smile a 
smile could bring you near to me

This world has lost its glory 
let's start a brand new story 
Right now there'll be no other 
time and I can show you

Talk an everlasting words and
dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my love
I'm here if you should call to me
